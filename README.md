Mailplane4Quicksilver
=====================

A simple AppleScript to enable quickly mailing attachments starting with a selected file in Finder or Path Finder.

I use it like this:

1. Select your file in (Path) Finder.
2. ⌘␣ to launch Quicksilver.
3. ⌘G to load the current selection in the first Quicksilver pane.
4. ⇥ to move to second Quicksilver pane.
5. 'emmp' for Email with Mailplane is what I taught Quicksilver to use for this action.  YMMV.
6. ⇥ to third Quicksilver pane
7. Type your desired recipient.

The email uses baked in text for the subject line and body text.  There's a similar action for Quicksilver and OS X Mail.app that I used as a model.

To use this script

1. Place this script in the following location:
        /Users/<user>/Library/Application Support/Quicksilver/Actions

2. Restart Quicksilver
